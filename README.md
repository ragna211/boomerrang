# boomerrang
this is basically a simple code to make boomerrang.
We are capturing frames live from the webcam.
These frames are joined in different orders to make original, reverse video and the boomerrang.
Frames are joined in the same order as they are to make original video.
Frames are joined in the reverse order to make reverse video.
Frames are joined in the same and reverse order alternatively to make a boomerrang.
